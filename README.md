Leaf Classification
==============================
Kaggle "Leaf Classification" database classification project for IFT712.

For package installation, you may run*: 
> pip install -r "requirements.txt"

*In case there is an error regarding "pkg-resources==0.0.0", you may try removing it from the requirements.txt file.
There seem to be a general issue regarding this particular package and v env.

Data Initialisation
------------
Make sure there is a "data" folder as presented below with your raw data into "data/raw".

You may then run (you need Make to execute Makefile):
> make data
